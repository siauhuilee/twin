Twin IDE is a Java application that graphically exposes the automation tree of an application, and allows you to perform some actions to see how they work an experiment.

It uses the Java client library, so everything you can do in the IDE is possible to automate. However the IDE doesn't expose the full feature set of Twin.

The name comes from [Selenium IDE](http://seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/), although it is not yet as full-featured.
