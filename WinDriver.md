Twin used to be known internally as WinDriver, by analogy with [WebDriver](http://code.google.com/p/webdriver) (now merged with [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org)).

It conflicted with (among others) [Wind River](http://www.windriver.com/) so we changed it before the public release.

So if eBay people mention the name, it's a slip of the tongue and refers to Twin.
