Twin is a tool for automating Windows graphical applications.

That is, it enables you to write code to click buttons, enter text, and view the results just as a user would.

Twin was developed at eBay to allow automatic functional testing of Windows software like [Turbo Lister](http://pages.ebay.com/turbo_lister/).

The design is based on the web automation tool [Selenium/WebDriver](http://www.seleniumhq.org), and it can be used in similar ways. Grid 2.0 from webdriver was designed with TWIN in mind, so you can test against multiple virtual machines with different OS installed and let grid 2.0 install the last version of the AUT  and route the tests to the correct VM.
